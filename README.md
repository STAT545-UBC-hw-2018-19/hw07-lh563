# Homework 07-lh563
Welcome to my hw07 repo. This repo include my package folder [powers-master](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw07-lh563/tree/master/powers-master).

The powers-master is a pakage from [Vincenzo Coia's repo](https://github.com/vincenzocoia/powers) where I have edited and added a new function called [lm_plot](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw07-lh563/blob/master/powers-master/R/new_function.R) to visualize the linear regression model.
